# Hacktoberfest 2024

Welcome to **Hacktoberfest 2024**! ðŸŽ‰

Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open-source software, encouraging participation in the open-source community through contributions. Whether you're a seasoned developer or new to coding, your contributions are valuable and welcome.

## How to Participate

1. **Register for Hacktoberfest**: Sign up on the [official Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com) to get started.

2. **Find Repositories**:
   - Look for repositories tagged with the `hacktoberfest` topic.
   - Contribute to projects that have issues labeled `hacktoberfest-accepted`.
   - Ensure the repository is public and not archived.

3. **Make Meaningful Contributions**:
   - Your pull/merge requests (PRs/MRs) should add value to the project.
   - Avoid trivial changes like fixing typos or formatting.

4. **Submit Your PRs/MRs**:
   - PRs/MRs must be created between **October 1 and October 31**.
   - They should be accepted by the project's maintainer.

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on making meaningful contributions that improve the project.

- **Respect Project Guidelines**: Adhere to the contribution guidelines provided by the project maintainers.

- **Avoid Spam**:
  - Do not submit automated or scripted PRs/MRs.
  - Refrain from making PRs/MRs that are irrelevant or disruptive.

## Acceptance Criteria

Your PRs/MRs must meet the following criteria to count toward Hacktoberfest:

- **Timing**: Created between October 1 and October 31.

- **Repository**: Contributed to a public, unarchived repository.

- **Approval**:
  - **Merged** by a maintainer, **or**
  - Labeled as `hacktoberfest-accepted`, **or**
  - Given an overall approving review.

- **Status**: Not marked as a draft and not labeled as `spam` or `invalid`.

## Seven-Day Review Period

- After your PR/MR meets the acceptance criteria, it enters a **seven-day review period**.

- During this time, maintainers or Hacktoberfest organizers may invalidate the PR/MR if it doesn't meet the guidelines.

- Once the review period is over and your PR/MR still meets all the checks, it will count toward your Hacktoberfest goals.

## Reducing Spam

To maintain the quality of contributions:

- **Maintainers Can Mark PRs/MRs as Spam**:
  - PRs/MRs labeled with `spam` will not be counted.
  - Contributors with two or more spammy PRs/MRs may be disqualified.

- **Exclusion of Bad Repositories**:
  - Repositories that encourage low-quality contributions will be excluded.
  - Such PRs/MRs will not count toward Hacktoberfest.

- **Reporting Issues**:
  - If you encounter a repository or PR/MR that goes against Hacktoberfest values, report it to the organizers for review.
